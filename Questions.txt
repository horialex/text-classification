What is word polarity and?


**Insights and Questions**

1. We have a vocabulary file under 'other-data' named 'imdb.vocab' that 
   is not directly used but if we make our vocabulary it is very similar to that one.

2. Extra files we have besides the reviews 
   How does vocabulary file help us? 
   How does LabeledBow.feat (word-frequency) file help us 
   How does the polarization file - 'imdber.txt' help us? can we see the polarization in our model if it mathces with that file 
   or can we somehow use that file, is it just for refference or can it be used?

3. Vobulary size:
   In our example the vocabulary size (max_features) is set to 10 000, this means that 10 000 words are used,
    the vocabulary file has around 90k words. Is this 10k enough can we tinker with that number and will it help us?

4. Sequence length:
   This determines the vector size and the number of tokens (words in our case) that are allowed in a vector. This means that after 
   we apply standardization techinques on the review text only the first 250 words will be stored. If the review is less than 250 words, the 
   rest of tokens will refrence 0 - empty word.

5. The vector will not hold words but stores the indexes of the words. It is like a reffrence table.

6. We want to implement data pipelines so it will be easier to play with the data parameters

7. We need to see if we can find some transfromers or some way to better deal with the data, maybe there is a way to give more importance to
   certain words that are leaning more towards positive or negative semantics.

8. We must find out the number of words per each review and see the avearge length or see how this is distributed.

9. imdb.vcab holds every unique word found in the reviews

10. .feat files stores the number of occurance of words per review and the score of each review. 
    A score between 1 and 4 is negative, 5-6 neutral and 7-10 positive

11. The reviews are named in the following format: {index}_{score}.txt

12. The unsupervised folder stores the reviews in the format: {index}_0.txt - 0 meaning unlabelled.

13. If we have a strong enough model can we use it to label the unlabelled dataset?
